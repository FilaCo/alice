# Introduction

This is the reference manual for the Alice programming language. 

Alice is a statically typed, data-oriented programming language designed for systems with complex data relationships. The language adopts an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, making it well-suited for game development, simulations, and data processing.

Systems in Alice execute concurrently by default, with no guaranteed ordering between independent systems. 

Components (a.k.a props) are globally accessible while systems are private and cannot be referred to directly. Programs are organized through C-style inclusion mechanisms rather than complex packaging systems.
